 # 🛒 E-Commerce-Project

This project is a user-friendly and dynamic e-commerce shopping cart application developed using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript (JS), and API integration. Users can add or remove products, adjust quantities, and update cart contents. The products are fetched from an external JSON file (db.json) and dynamically displayed on the page, while cart data is stored using localStorage to ensure persistence even after a page refresh. Additionally, the cart icon updates automatically based on the total number of items, providing real-time notifications. With a responsive design, the application ensures seamless accessibility across different devices, enhancing the overall shopping experience.
